# Motivating Questions

1. Are there any notable keywords or phrases that the Pitchfork tends to use for negative reviews? How
about for positive or average reviews?
2. Over the years cataloged do any genres show trends of becoming more positively or negatively reviewed?
Any displayed biases towards genres or specific artists?
3. What are the top rated and worst rated artists across their discography? Do they have any commonalities?
